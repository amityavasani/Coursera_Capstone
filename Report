Problem/Background
Although the city of San Francisco and the surrounding bay area has become renowned for the abundance of talent it has, there have been unintended consequences of these actions. Amongst these consequences include rapidly increasing costs of living as more and more people are interested in moving to the bay area in pursuit of hot tech jobs. There are many stories of individuals who work at well-paid jobs only to be living out of their car due to the difficulty of finding an affordable home in this area. However, as technology continues to expand into nearly every aspect of our lives, other areas of the country are quickly acquiring bright engineers and computer scientists. In particular, Austin is one example of a city that has blossomed into an attractive location for young tech-savvy individuals. It is for this reason that I want to compare the cities of Austin and San Francisco to allow individuals to weigh the pros and cons of living in each city before making their final decision.
